                        I am a web developer based in India,I am passionate about coding
                        since my schooldays. After completion of my schooling i pursued computer science and
                        engineering. From there I learned backend development and eventually 
                        turned into frontend development. Currently iam working as a fullstack developer.
                        Other than coding i like sports , Iam a supporter of Chelsea football club.
